
# What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

* Assume the user knows what he or she is doing and doesn't need to be shielded from the power and potential dangers of the command line.  Treat the user with respect.

* The Open Source development model allows the code to evolve at the hands of users who are motivated by building good software, rather than by profit.

* Small is beautiful and each program should do one thing well.


# In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A VPS is a walled-off slice of a shared server's resources that runs it's own copy of the operatig system and allows the user root level access.  Advantages of using a VPS:
* The user is not at the mercy of other users on the same server.
* The user has more control than with shared hosting.
* Cost effective and easily scalable.
* You can blow the whole thing up and start over!

# Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

As the root user, the user has access to all files, including critical system files.  One false move and the root user could destroy the entire server.
