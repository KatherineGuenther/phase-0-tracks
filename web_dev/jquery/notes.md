
# PLAN OF ATTACK
* Perform Google search for jQuery
* Identify a mix of articles and tutorials that won't exceed 2 hrs to read/do
* Work for 1 hour then take a walk to get the mail
* Return for 1 hour
* Eat lunch then tackle Release 2

# EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES
* Worked well for me to mix a tutorial or two in with some reading.  I started with a general introduction to jQuery then switched to something more hands on.  The hands-on tutorials invariably led me to more reading to research specific topics that weren't clear.  Lunch was also effective!
