What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
Semantic tags give meaning to the content of an HTML element.  They tell the browser and the developer how to interpret the content of the node.  It would be hard to do much of anything useful without <head>, <body>, <header>, <p> and <nav>.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
The browser displays the elements in the order they appear in the html file.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
I learned how to create a snippet.  I suspect I'll be creating a lot of them in the future.  With a name that's 18 characters long, I can see the benefit of creating one for my contact info today!  

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
I feel pretty comfortable with the concepts, but still struggling with the process of pairing.  When a session isn't really flowing, I'm not sure when to just sit back and when to jump in.  Fortunately there are many more opportunities to improve on this!
